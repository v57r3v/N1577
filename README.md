Seminar 2. The Economics of   Banking
Students   are   required   to   work   in   groups   to   discuss   the   following   questions   and problems.   At   the end of   the discussion, a nominated student will make a   short presentation.
1.       Why are financial intermediaries willing   to   engage   in   information   collection   activities   when   investors   in   financial   instruments   maybe   unwilling   to   do   so?
2.       Suppose you go to your   local bank,   intending to   buy   a   certificate   of   deposit   with   your   savings. A person enters the bank and applies for a   car   loan.

3.       What      specific      procedures      do      financial      intermediaries      use      to      reduce      asymmetric   information problems in lending?
4.       Many   policymakers   in   developing   countries   have   proposed   the   implementation   of a   system   of   deposit   insurance   similar   to   the   system   that   exists   in   the   United    States.   Explain why this might create more problems than   solutions   in   the   financial   system   of   a developing country.
